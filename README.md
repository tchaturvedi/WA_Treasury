## Content Folder Description
The content folder is root folder for all the pages shown on our website.
Every page that you want to display should be added to under this folder in .md. 
You can also group several files and put them inside a subdirectory under content folder

For instance:
* Content
  * firstpage.md
  * secondpage.md
  * first subdirectory
    * firstnested.md
    * secondnested.md
    * thirdnested.md
  * thirdpage.md

All of these files and subdirectories name need to be lower case with **NO** special characters

Inside each .md files you will see a key word *order* followed by a colon and a number starting from 0.
This is how the program recognize where in the table of contents should should every page tab link appear.

The rest of these files are straight forward Markdown Language
