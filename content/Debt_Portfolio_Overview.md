Following more than a decade of significant expansion, growth in the debt portfolio of the State of Washington is slowing to a more modest pace. New money issuance of bonds has declined somewhat from the peaks of 2010 and 2012 and a growing volume of bonds is maturing annually.

Washington’s debt obligations include Various Purpose General Obligation (VP GO) bonds, Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax General Obligation (MVFT GO) bonds and Certificates of Participation (COPs). Transportation funding also includes Triple Pledge bonds (backed by toll revenues, motor vehicle fuel taxes, and ultimately
the State’s general obligation pledge), Federal Highway Grant Anticipation Revenue Bonds (GARVEEs) and a
loan from the Federal Highway Administration (TIFIA).

At the end of 2015, Washington's debt portfolio stood at $20.6 billion, an increase of only three percent over
two years. Within the portfolio, increasing issuance of VP GO and COP obligations has been partially offset
by reduced issuance of bonds for transportation projects. Nonetheless, total annual payments of principal and
interest will reach nearly $2.0 billion in FY 2016, accounting for approximately 6.3 percent of general fund state revenues and 40 percent of motor vehicle fuel tax revenues.
