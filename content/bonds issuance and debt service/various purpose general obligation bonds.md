# VARIOUS PURPOSE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS

Various Purpose General Obligation (VP GO) bonds are issued to pay for a wide variety of projects including K-12 school construction, higher education facilities, correctional facilities, environmental preservation, state office buildings, and public works infrastructure. In recent years, bonds have funded from 35 to nearly 60 percent of the biennial capital budget. The reliance on bond financings fluctuates over time depending on operating budget requirements and as state revenues expand or constrain debt capacity.

The State irrevocably pledges its full faith, credit and taxing power to the payment of general obligations of the State. The ability of the State to make this pledge is provided in the State Constitution.

There is no express provision in the Constitution or in state law on the priority of payment of debt service on state debt as compared to the payment of other State obligations. The constitutional mandate regarding payment of State debt, however, does require that the Legislature appropriate sufficient funds to pay State debt when due, and provides expressly for judicial enforcement of the State’s payment obligation on that debt. No other provision of the Constitution contains comparable language providing courts with authority to compel payment of other State obligations.

General obligation bonds are the State’s most highly rated obligations and offer the lowest cost of funds.

Annual issuance of VP GO bonds is again increasing after declining from 2009 to 2013. Excluding refundings, issuance of VP GO bonds peaked at $1.27 billion in FY 2009 and is expected to total approximately $880 million in FY 2016

The portion of state resources used for debt service continues to edge lower as revenue growth outpaces debt issuance. Prior to the great recession, the portion of general fund revenues spent on debt service was in the 5 percent range. From 2007 to 2010, annual revenues fell by $2 billion while debt service continued to climb, driving up the share of revenues used to repay debt from 5 percent to 7 percent of the budget. In 2016, debt service on VP GO bonds is projected to total nearly $1.2 billion or 6.3% of general state revenues.
