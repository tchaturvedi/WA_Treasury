# TRANSPORTATION BONDS: MVFT GO, TRIPLE PLEDGE AND GARVEE BONDS

Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax General Obligation (MVFT GO) bonds are paid from state excise taxes on motor vehicle fuels and are backed by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the State.  Proceeds of MVFT GO bonds are constitutionally restricted to highway capital projects for public highways, county roads, bridges, city streets, and the ferry system. MVFT GO bonds carry the same ratings as VP GO bonds and borrowing rates are the same.

Over the past decade Washington has significantly increased its reliance on MVFT GO bonds to support legislative spending plans associated with gas tax hikes. Fully leveraging revenues from the gas tax increases of the 2003 Nickel Act and the 2005 Transportation Partnership Act increased the State’s annual MVFT GO issuance from $65 million in the 1990s to over $500 million by 2013. In 2015, the Legislature approved further increases in gas taxes in the Connecting Washington transportation package and directed these revenues to specific capital projects.

In FY 2015, debt service on MVFT GO bonds rose to nearly $600 million, representing 30 percent of state transportation revenues, and half of pledged motor vehicle fuel tax revenues. This is more than double the $215 million paid with only 20 percent of MVFT revenues in 2007. In 2016, the amount of leverage will decline as revenue increases with the Connecting Washington gas tax hikes and the addition of vehicle related license fees to revenues pledged to new bonds.

Triple Pledge bonds are MVFT GO bonds which are first paid from toll revenue as part of the financing for the SR 520 Corridor (Series 2012C MVFT GO (SR 520 Corridor Program – Toll Revenue)). Triple Pledge Bonds carry the same ratings as VP GO bonds and borrowing rates are the same.

In addition, the State has issued two forms of transportation bonds which are not backed by the general obligation pledge: (1) Federal Highway Grant Anticipation Revenue Bonds, or GARVEE bonds are secured solely by funds received from the Federal Highway Administration, and (2) the TIFIA bond is a draw-down loan from the Federal Highway Administration which is paid solely from SR 520 toll revenues. The SR 520 Corridor Program is the only program for which the Legislature has authorized issuance of GARVEE bonds.
