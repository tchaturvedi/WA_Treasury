# REIMBURSABLE GENERAL OBLIGATION DEBT

Approximately $1.6 billion of the State’s general obligation debt is reimbursable, or repaid from funds outside of
general fund-state revenues and motor vehicle fuel tax revenues.  Reimbursable VP GO debt includes: bonds for technical
education facilities that are repaid from investment income on the Permanent Common School Fund, certain bonds for
higher education facilities that are repaid from parking or student fees, bonds for a stadium and exhibit center repaid
from admission, parking and certain sales taxes, and financings for “multimodal’ facilities that are repaid from
licenses and fees. In addition, nearly $1 billion MVFT GO and Triple Pledge bonds are paid from toll revenues from the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge or the SR 520 Corridor. In these financings, state statute or bond covenants require that tolls
are set to generate revenues to repay the debt.
