# DEBT PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW

Following more than a decade of significant expansion, growth in the debt portfolio of the State of Washington is slowing to a more modest pace. New money issuance of bonds has declined somewhat from the peaks of 2010 and 2012 and a growing volume of bonds is maturing annually.
Washington’s debt obligations include Various Purpose General Obligation (VP GO) bonds, Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax General Obligation (MVFT GO) bonds and Certificates of Participation (COPs).  Transportation funding also includes Triple Pledge bonds (backed by toll revenues, motor vehicle fuel taxes, and ultimately the State’s general obligation pledge), Federal Highway Grant Anticipation Revenue Bonds (GARVEEs) and a loan from the Federal Highway Administration (TIFIA).
At the end of 2015, Washington's debt portfolio stood at $20.6 billion, an increase of only three percent over two years. Within the portfolio, increasing issuance of VP GO and COP obligations has been partially offset by reduced issuance of bonds for transportation projects. Nonetheless, total annual payments of principal and interest will reach nearly $2.0 billion in FY 2016, accounting for approximately 6.3 percent of general fund state revenues and 40 percent of motor vehicle fuel tax revenues.

The State’s borrowings have historically been structured with level debt service; much like a standard fixed-rate home
mortgage, a portion of what has been borrowed is repaid every year and annual payments of principal and interest are
approximately equal. With each bond sale, incremental debt service is added to each year through the final maturity.
Approximately half of the State’s current GO debt will be repaid by 2024, or in about 9 years.
