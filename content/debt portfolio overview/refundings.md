# REFUNDINGS
The Office of the State Treasurer regularly monitors the debt portfolio to identify opportunities to lower borrowing
costs by refunding bonds. All refundings are executed in accordance with debt policies of the State Finance Committee
which specify minimum savings thresholds. From January 2009 through January 2016, low market interest rates and the
 Stateâ€™s stable rating enabled the State to refund $9.3 billion general obligation bonds, saving taxpayers $1.2
  billion in nominal principal and interest payments or $981 million on a present value basis. Seventy percent of these
  savings are credited to the general fund, the remainder to the transportation budget.
