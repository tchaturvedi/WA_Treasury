# BORROWING COSTS

The State executes most bond sales through a competitive electronic auction process. Through most of 2015, borrowing
costs remained near historical lows as the Federal Reserve deferred raising short-term interest rates. At the most
recent sale of general obligation bonds with a 25-year final maturity and level debt service, the True Interest Co
(TIC) was 3.49%. The weighted average cost of funds on the entire VP GO portfolio currently stands at 3.40 %.
