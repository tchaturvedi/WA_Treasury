# OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

**63-20 Revenue Bonds**

The State has entered into two long-term leases with separate nonprofit corporations that issued “63-20” lease revenue bonds on behalf of the State.  With this type of financing, a non-profit corporation issues bonds on behalf of the State and uses the proceeds to manage the design and construction of a facility.  Once the project has been completed, the State leases the facility from the non-profit and the lease payments are pledged to the repayment of the bonds.  The State does not take title to the property until the bonds have been paid.  The State’s lease payments are subject to appropriation risk and across-the-board cuts by the Governor.  The State’s 63-20 financings were issued for 20 and 30 years. Borrowing costs on these financings are higher than those on similarly structured COPs.

**Guaranteed Education Tuition Program**

The Washington Guaranteed Education Tuition Program (“GET program”) is a 529 prepaid college tuition plan that allows Washington residents to prepay for college tuition.  Individual accounts are guaranteed by the State to keep pace with rising college tuition, based on the highest tuition at Washington’s public universities.  The after-tax contributions to a GET account grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free when used for eligible higher education expenses.

The budget enacted in the 2015 Legislative session reduced tuition for state colleges and universities. Payout values for units redeemed during the 2015-16 and 2016-17 academic years are unchanged from the value in effect before the tuition reduction. For academic years thereafter, the GET Committee is authorized to make program adjustments necessary to ensure that the total payout value of each account is not decreased or diluted as a result of the tuition changes. The GET Committee has suspended new program enrollments and most purchases of new units for up to two years. The GET Committee is currently exploring establishing a direct fund 529 college savings plan.

According to the actuarial valuation performed by the Office of the State Actuary (“OSA”), the market value of GET program assets as of June 30, 2015 totaled $2.86 billion, in excess of the “best estimate” of the actuarially determined present value of obligations of $2.04 billion.  However, OSA has noted that it is difficult to fully estimate the full extent of the 2015 legislation to reduce tuition at all public institutions of higher learning in FY2016 and FY2017 and to limit tuition growth in future years.

**Pensions**

The pension plans of the State of Washington are consistently recognized as some of the better funded plans in the nation. The State administers 13 defined benefit retirement plans, three of which contain hybrid defined benefit/defined contribution options.  As of June 30, 2014, the plans covered an estimated 530,000 eligible state and local government employees.  The Office of the State Actuary’s (OSA) most recent actuarial valuation shows that the funded status for all the state-administered retirement plans combined as of June 30, 2014 is 93 percent comparing liabilities estimated using the Projected Unit Credit cost method to the Actuarial Value of Assets. Estimating liabilities for the same period using the Entry Age Normal cost method adjusts the funded status of all the State administered plans combined to 87 percent. Under the new GASB reporting standards, the State’s share of Net Pension Liabilities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 is $1,529 million.

**OPEBs (Other Post Employment Benefits)**

The State provides health care benefits to its retirees through implicit and explicit subsidies.  But unlike the State’s pensions, both the implicit and explicit subsidies are not contractual obligations to retirees. The State allows retirees not yet eligible for Medicare to use their own money to pay for health insurance at group rates negotiated for public employees (an implicit subsidy).  While there is no contractual liability for the State, including retirees in this purchasing pool marginally increases overall insurance rates.  The State provides an explicit subsidy to reduce Medicare-eligible retiree Part A and B premiums by an amount determined each year by the Public Employee Benefits Board (PEBB).  Like the implicit subsidy, this is also not a contractual obligation because each year the Legislature determines whether or not to include it in the state budget.
