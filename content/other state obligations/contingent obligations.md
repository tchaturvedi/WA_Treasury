# CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS

Contingent obligations are obligations the State may face in the event that other governmental entities are not able to meet their financial commitments. These include voter-approved school district bonds supported by the State School Bond Guarantee Program and local government leases financed through the Stateâ€™s COP program. It is important to note that the State has never been called upon to pay debt service on any bonds guaranteed in the School Bond Guarantee Program or on any local government lease financed by a COP.  If the State does at some point step in to make up a temporary shortfall, the debt remains the responsibility of the local government.

Neither of these programs involves state debt, and they have provided significant value to other government entities. Since its inception in 2000, the School Bond Guarantee Program has saved school districts an estimated $11 million annually.
