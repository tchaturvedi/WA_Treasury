The State borrows to undertake capital projects such as building construction, land acquisition, and transportation projects. With each borrowing, the State makes a commitment to repay the debt with regular and approximately equal payments of principal and interest over the term of the borrowing. The term of the borrowing is always within the expected useful life of the assets being financed. 

The alternative to debt financing is pay-as-you-go funding, or cash funding capital expenditures with revenues
received over time. Debt financing is more expensive as the State pays interest, but funds are available for
project construction sooner. Debt-financing can also promote tax equity as each asset is paid for over its
useful life. However, leveraging future tax revenues with debt financing commits resources from future
biennia for todayâ€™s capital projects.
