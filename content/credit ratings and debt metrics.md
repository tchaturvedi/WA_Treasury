# CREDIT RATINGS AND DEBT METRICS

Washington continues to be characterized by high income levels, solid population growth and a diverse state economy. For these reasons, the State continues to receive high marks from credit rating agencies. The State’s ratings from Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P are in the second highest category. These strong and stable ratings are critical to ensure that the State pays low interest rates on all borrowings.

These same economic and demographic characteristics also provide insight as to why Washington's debt ratios are higher than the national medians and higher than debt ratios in other similar states.  Washington's debt burden places it among the top 10 states in the nation as measured by: debt per capita, debt as a percentage of personal income, debt service as a percentage of governmental expenditures, and debt as a percentage of gross state product. While citing the State's debt levels as a potential risk, each rating agency has recognized that fundamental credit strengths of the State mitigate the above-average debt burden.

*Fitch (October 2015)*

*Washington's debt levels are in the upper moderate range and well above average for a U.S. state, with pro forma net tax-supported debt as of Oct. 8, 2015 equal to 5.7% of personal income. Debt is primarily GO. Capital needs are substantial, particularly for transportation, and tolling is part of the funding solution. Positively, the state has increased its focus on debt affordability. In November 2012, voters approved a constitutional amendment that tightened the constitutional debt limit.*

*Moody’s (September 2015)*

*Washington's debt ratios are more than twice Moody's 2015 50-state median level; net tax-supported debt as a percentage of personal income is 6.2%, compared with Moody's 50-state median of 2.5%. Despite the significant increase in total debt outstanding during the previous decade, the debt-to-personal income ratio has remained fairly stable due to Washington's strong personal income growth. Washington's net-tax supported debt per capita ($2,892) is more than twice the national median of $1,012. Annual debt service costs relative to revenue available for debt service (Moody's calculation) was also relatively high at 9.8% in fiscal 2014 versus a median of 5.3%.*

*Standard and Poor’s (September 2015)*

*Washington’s debt is moderately high by several of our measures. Debt pay down is average, with 44% of outstanding principal amortized over 10 years. Gross GO and lease appropriation-backed debt service is moderate, at 5.46% of the funds’ expenditures from which it pays debt service. Portions of the state's debt are funded from self-supporting or reimbursable sources, however.  Considering just the general fund, adjusted for these offsetting revenues, we estimate that debt service was 6.4%, moderate in our view.*

Credit analysts recognize the importance of a state’s overall liability profile when reviewing debt affordability. While the debt metrics above place the State in the top for each of these debt metrics, Washington’s relative ranking improves significantly when the broader liability profile is taken into account. For example, as shown in Figure 20, in 2015 Washington ranks 7th in debt per capita. However, if both per capita pension liabilities and debt per capita are measured, its ranking drops below the median to the 27th position.

Washington’s debt metrics improved modestly in 2015 compared to previous years. Debt is smaller in relation to person income and debt service account for a smaller share of general spending.

It is useful to compare Washington’s debt metrics with those of other states with comparable or higher credit ratings and similar demographic characteristics. Many of these states have fundamentally different economic, revenue, debt and income characteristics. Within this list of states, only Massachusetts has higher debt per capita and more debt as a percentage of personal income. In Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Oregon debt service payments are a larger share of general spending.
